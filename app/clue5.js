// Having found everything else we now need to figure out the location of Carmen's hideout

// We need a warrant to properly arrest Carmen for her crimes so we need to provide the following information about carmen: 
// Add the following properties to the carmen object: 
  // name (Carmen SanDiego)
  // heightInInches, (67) 
  // captured, (false) 
  // outfit (red hat, red coat, yellow scarf, black boots) 
// The name property should have a value that is a string, the height property 
// heightInInches should have a value that is a number, the captured property should have a 
// boolean value, and the outfit property should have a value that is an 
// array. Inside the array, include at least 4 string values.

let carmen = {
  //your code in here
}

// So the warrent gets updated as quickly as possible our database needs to quickly check if she has been captured

// write a function that returns the value of the captured property on your carmen object using dot notation.
function isCaptured() {
  // your code inside here
  // don't forget to use the return keyword
}


// ANCHOR keep up the chase here
// Cat Challenges

let cat = {
  name: "Pickles",
  legs: 4,
  whiskers: true,
  likes: ["napping", "playing", "running at 2:00am", "pets", "stealing food off the counter"]
}

// Write a function that uses bracket notation to change the cat's name from 
// "Pickles" to "Kevin".Then use either dot or bracket notation to return 
// the value of the name property.
function renameCat() {
}

// Create a function that uses dot or bracket notation to create a property 
// on the cat object called "color" and assign it to any color you'd like. 
// Then return the value of the color property.

function colorTheCat() {
  // your code inside here
}

// Delete the whiskers property off of the cat object. You may use either dot or bracket notation.


// Write a function that uses dot AND bracket notation to access and return the 
// value of the fourth item in the likes array("pets"). 
// Example: objectName.property[indexNumber]

function returnIndex(cat) {
  // your code inside here
}
